        <h3>Employment discrimination happens when an employee or job applicant is treated unfavorably because of his or her race,
             skin color, national origin, gender, disability, religion, or age. </h3>
        
        <p1><b> Examples of discrimination include</b><br>- denying certain employees compensation or benefits<br> -paying equally-qualified employees in the same position different salaries<br>- discriminating when assigning disability leave, maternity leave or retirement options<br> -denying use of company facilities.</p1>
      
		<p> <b>The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) enforces federal laws prohibiting discrimination. Some of these laws are:</b>
        <br>
-<i>The Civil Rights Act of 1964</i> protects employees and job applicants from employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, and national origin. 
<br>-<i>The Pregnancy Discrimination Act </i>protections regarding “sex” to include prohibiting sex discrimination on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, and a medical condition related to pregnancy or childbirth.
<br>-<i>The Equal Pay act of 1963</i> protects men and women from sex-based wage discrimination in the payment of wages or benefits.
<br>-<i>The Age Discrimination Act of 1967</i> protects persons 40 years of age or older from age-based employment discrimination.
<br>-<i>The Rehabilitation Act</i> protects employees and job applicants from employment discrimination based on disabilities.

<p>To start, file a charge of discrimination, a signed statement saying that an employer, union or labor organization engaged in employment discrimination. The EEOC, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, will investigate and give you a Notice of Right to Sue when they closed the investigation. Once you receive that, you have 90 days to sue.
To File a Charge of Discrimination, go through the  
<a href = "https://publicportal.eeoc.gov/Portal/Login.aspx">EEOC Public Portal</a>. You will also have to submit an an inquiry and an interview.
     </p>
     
    <p>
    If you are a federal employ, there is a different procedure.  The first step is to contact an EEO Counselor within 45 days. The counselor will give you the option of participating in counseling or alternate dispute resolution. If you cannot resolve it, you can file a formal discrimination complaint against the agency with the agency's EEO Office within 15 days. Once you have filed it, the agency will decide whether to dismiss it or not and conduct an investigation. When the investigation is finished, the agency will issue a notice giving you two choices: either request a hearing before an EEOC Administrative Judge or ask the agency to issue a decision as to whether the discrimination occurred. If you want to ask for a hearing, you must make your request in writing or via the EEOC Public Portal located at
    <a href = "https://publicportal.eeoc.gov/.">EEOC Public Portal</a>. If you ask the agency to issue a decision and no discrimination is found, or if you disagree with some part of the decision, you can appeal the decision to EEOC or challenge it in federal district court.
